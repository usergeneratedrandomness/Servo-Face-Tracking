## Hardware
  

 1.  Two servos ( For X and Y axis Rotation)
 2. Arduino ( Any model)
 3. Male to Male jumper Cables X 6 
 4. (Optional) Tilt and Pan brackets for the servos

## Required Python Packages

  1. CVZone
  2. cv2
  3. pyfirmata
  4. numpy
  5. mediapipe

## Additional Information

StandardFirmata library is uploaded to the Arduino using Arduino IDE. Ensure that lighting conditions is good, correct COM port is in the code ('COM3' by default), servos are connected (pin 9 for x-axis and pin 10 for y-axis as default). Extra comments written for extra information in code.
