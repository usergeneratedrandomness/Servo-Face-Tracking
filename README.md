# Servo-Hand-Tracking(pointer finger)
Using cvzone to track fingers and servos to point towards the pointer finger.
Written in python.
Required Hardware:
  1) 2 servos(for x nad y axis rotation)
  2) arduino
  3) male to male jumper cables X 6
  4) servo tilt and pan prackets(optional)
Required packages:
  1) CVZone
  2) cv2
  3) pyfirmata
  4) numpy
Standardfirmata libary is uploaded to the arduino using Arduino IDE
Ensure that lighting conditions is good,
correct COM port is in the code ('COM3' by default),
servos are connected (pin 9 for x-axis and pin 10 for y-axis as default)
comments written for extra information in code.
